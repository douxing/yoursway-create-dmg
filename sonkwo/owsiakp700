1. Download the slas_for_udifs_1.0.dmg from Apple’s Developer page (you can use free developer account for that)

Go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action, in Search field type in “SLAS” and download the DMG file (Software Licensing for UDIF)

2. Mount the slas_for_udifs_1.0.dmg image – simply double click it. You will find two files there: SLA Instructions.rtf and SLAResources

3. Open Terminal and execute following commands

cd /Volumes/SLAs_for_UDIFs_1.0
DeRez SLAResources > /tmp/sla.r
Note! It may turn out that you have to download “Command Line Tools for Xcode” in case you have Mac with OS X Lion preinstalled.

4. This file – /tmp/sla.r – is a resources file with license definition. Your license will be based on this file

5. Open /tmp/sla.r and change it according to your needs

Basically, you can leave following sections:

data 'TMPL' (128, "LPic") {
  /* leave the content as is */
}

data 'LPic' (5000) {
  /* leave the content as is */
}

data 'STR#' (5000, "English buttons") {
  /* leave the content as is */
}

data 'STR#' (5002, "English") {
  /* leave the content as is */
}

data 'TEXT' (5000, "English SLA") {
  "This is the place where you want to\n"
  "add your license\n"
}

data 'styl' (5000, "English SLA") {
  /* leave the content as is */
}
